  <h2>CSS</h2>
  <p>Stands for "Cascading Style Sheet." Cascading style sheets are used to format the layout of Web pages.
    They can be used to define text styles, <br>table sizes, and other aspects of Web pages that previously
    could only be defined in a page's HTML.</p>

<strong>CSS</strong> helps Web developers create a uniform look across several pages of a Web site.
<br>Instead of defining the style of each table and each block of text within a page's HTML,
<br>commonly used styles need to be defined only once in a CSS document.
<br>Once the style is defined in cascading style sheet,
<br>it can be used by any page that references the CSS file. Plus,
<br>CSS makes it easy to change styles across several pages at once.
<br>For example, a Web developer may want to increase the default text size
<br>from 10pt to 12pt for fifty pages of a Web site. If the pages all reference
<br>the same style sheet, the text size only needs to be changed on the style sheet
<br>and all the pages will show the larger text.</p>
<p>
<br>While CSS is great for creating text styles, it is helpful for formatting other aspects of Web page layout as well.
<br>For example, CSS can be used to define the cell padding of table cells, the style, thickness, and color of a
<br>table's border, and the padding around images or other objects. CSS gives Web developers more exact control
<br>over how Web pages will look than HTML does. This is why most Web pages today incorporate cascading style sheets.</p>
