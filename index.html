    <br>Web is a computer programming system created by Donald E. Knuth as the first implementation of what he called
    <br>"literate programming": the idea that one could create software as works of literature,
    <br>by embedding source code inside descriptive text, rather than the reverse (as is common practice in most programming languages),
    <br>in an order that is convenient for exposition to human readers, rather than in the order demanded by the compiler.
    <br>Web consists of two secondary programs: TANGLE, which produces compilable Pascal code from the source texts,
    <br>and WEAVE, which produces nicely-formatted, printable documentation using TeX.CWEB is a version of Web for the C programming language,
    <br>while noweb is a separate literate programming tool, which is inspired by Web (as reflected in the name) and which is language agnostic.
    <br>The most significant programs written in Web are TeX and Metafont. Modern TeX distributions use another program Web2C to convert Web source to C.
