  <h2>HTML</h2>
  <p><strong><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2014/REC-html5-20141028/" target="_blank" title="html5 speicification">HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)</a></strong> is a markup language that tells <u>web</u> browsers
  <br>It can be as complicated or as simple as the web developer wants it to be.
  <br>HTML consists of a series of elements, which you use to enclose, wrap,
  <br>or mark up different parts of content to make it appear or act in a certain way.
  <br>The enclosing tags can make content into a hyperlink to connect to another page,
  <br>italicize words, and so on.</p>

  <p style="margin-top:40px;">At its heart, HTML is a language made up of elements,
  <br>which can be applied to pieces of text to give them
  <br>different meaning in a document (Is it a paragraph? Is it a bulleted list?
  <br>Is it part of a table?), structure a document into logical sections
  <br>(Does it have a header? Three columns of content? A navigation menu?),
  <br>and embed content such as images and videos into a page.
  <br>This module will introduce the first two of these and introduce
  <br>fundamental concepts and syntax you need to know to understand HTML.</p>
